# A-Pragmatic-Framework-for-Mobile-Redundant-Manipulator-Performing-Sequential-Tasks
In this paper, a framework combining base place- ment, path planning and redundancy resolution for a mobile manipulator performing sequential tasks, such as screwing, drilling or assembling tasks, is proposed. For a set of given tasks, the outputs of the proposed algorithm meet the following practical performance indicators: minimization of the number of the base positions, minimization of the number of manipulator joint configuration changes, feasibility of each task considering the force capacity of the manipulator (which takes benefit of redundancy resolution) and path planning of the end-effector motion with obstacle avoidance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated considering a 3 DOFs mobile platform and a 7 DOFs manipulator performing screwing in a application with 42 tasks.
